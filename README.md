## ⭐ Currently Working On:
- **Ongoing internship project:** Developed a full-stack weather forecast application using an Angular front-end and a .NET Core back-end, which retrieves and displays weather data through a responsive user interface. The application was initially run locally using Docker Compose, enabling seamless communication between services. After successful local testing, the code was pushed to an Azure Git repository. CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps were configured to build, test, and deploy both applications using Docker Compose, streamlining the deployment process and enhancing efficiency.

## 🎓 Completed Projects:
- **Digital Banking Application:** A full-stack project designed to provide efficient client and bank account management. This application features a user-friendly interface that allows clients to effortlessly manage their accounts, view transaction histories, and perform essential banking operations. 
- **YouTube Sentiment Analysis:** My project focuses on analyzing the sentiments of Tunisians toward various videos by extracting and analyzing comments in Arabic from the web. We achieved impressive sentiment analysis results using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, showcasing their effectiveness for this task.

To ensure high data quality for our analysis, we implemented several pre-processing steps. Additionally, we utilized web scraping techniques to extract relevant Tunisian comments, enabling us to gather a comprehensive dataset for our sentiment analysis.
